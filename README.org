* About
A test pattern generator based on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PNDeb/pinenote-debian-image/dev/overlays/root/rotating_cgradient_by_puck.html

But rewritten using libSDL2 to allow for more control of the rendering

* Requirements

~sudo apt install libsdl2-dev gcc~

* Building and running

#+begin_src sh
  ./buildpp.pl pinenote_test_pattern
#+end_src

Build and test it by running it:

#+begin_src sh
